# Barebones version!

My treasure chest of various dotfiles in my home directory.

Customized for use with:

* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [ls++](https://github.com/trapd00r/ls--)

Remember to also install:

* flake8 (`pip install flake8`)
* jshint (`npm install jshint`)

Be sure to configure vim with `--with-features=big` to enable unicode
characters, and `--enable-pythoninterp` for Python support.
