Research-backed techniques for creating highly effective AI prompts

## Foundational Principles

### The Golden Rule

**Show your prompt to a colleague with minimal context** - if they can't
understand it clearly, neither can the AI.

### Core Effectiveness Hierarchy

1. **Clarity** > Cleverness
2. **Specificity** > Generality
3. **Examples** > Explanations
4. **Structure** > Stream-of-consciousness
5. **Conciseness** > Verbosity

### Token Efficiency Principle

- **Target**: 25-30% word reduction improves cost and speed
- **Method**: One precise word > three vague words
- **Impact**: Better results with lower computational cost

### 4. Chain of Thought (Essential)

```xml
<thinking>
Let me break this down step by step:
1. First consideration...
2. Second analysis...
3. Final evaluation...
</thinking>

<answer>
Based on my analysis above...
</answer>
```

**Critical**: Without outputting thinking, no actual reasoning occurs

## Advanced Reasoning Methods

### 1. Multi-Shot Prompting (3-5 Examples Optimal)

**Research Evidence**: Consistent 15-20% improvement over zero-shot

```xml
<examples>
  <example>
    Input: Complex scenario 1
    Output: Detailed solution 1
  </example>
  <example>
    Input: Complex scenario 2  
    Output: Detailed solution 2
  </example>
  <example>
    Input: Complex scenario 3
    Output: Detailed solution 3
  </example>
</examples>
```

### 2. Self-Consistency Method

**Research**: +17.9% improvement on mathematical reasoning

1. Generate multiple reasoning paths
2. Select most consistent answer via majority vote
3. Most effective with 20-40 samples

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (For Complex Problems)

**Research**: 74% success rate vs 4% with standard CoT on Game of 24

- Enables exploration and backtracking
- Best for strategic planning, creative tasks
- Requires careful path evaluation

### 4. Prompt Chaining (For Multi-Step Tasks)

**Research**: +10.8% improvement on BigBench tasks

```
Step 1: "Extract key themes from this document"
↓
Step 2: "Based on themes [output1], write summary"  
↓
Step 3: "From summary [output2], generate recommendations"
```

## Word Efficiency Optimization

### Elimination Targets

| **Wordy**                      | **Efficient** | **Savings**  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| "due to the fact that"         | "because"     | 4 → 1 tokens |
| "in order to"                  | "to"          | 3 → 1 tokens |
| "for the purpose of"           | "to"          | 4 → 1 tokens |
| "at this point in time"        | "now"         | 5 → 1 tokens |
| "it is important to note that" | _delete_      | 7 → 0 tokens |

### Power Word Substitutions

| **Weak**       | **Strong**  | **Impact**                   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| "went quickly" | "rushed"    | Verb + adverb → precise verb |
| "very unique"  | "unique"    | Remove redundant intensifier |
| "quite good"   | "effective" | Replace vague qualifier      |
| "sort of like" | "resembles" | Remove hedging language      |

### Structural Optimization

```
❌ WORDY (47 tokens):
"I would like you to please analyze this data that I'm providing to you and then give me a comprehensive summary of what you find, making sure to include all the important details and insights."

✅ EFFICIENT (19 tokens):
"Analyze this data and provide a comprehensive summary with key insights."
```

**Result**: 59% token reduction, same meaning, clearer instruction

## Implementation Templates

### 1. Analysis Task Template

```xml
<role>Expert [DOMAIN] analyst with [X] years experience</role>

<task>
Analyze [SPECIFIC_ITEM] and provide [SPECIFIC_OUTPUT_FORMAT]
</task>

<criteria>
Focus on:
1. [CRITERION_1]
2. [CRITERION_2]  
3. [CRITERION_3]
</criteria>

<format>
Structure response as:
- Executive Summary
- Key Findings
- Recommendations
</format>

<examples>
[2-3 relevant examples]
</examples>
```

### 2. Creative Task Template

```xml
<thinking>
Let me consider:
1. Target audience: [AUDIENCE]
2. Key message: [MESSAGE]
3. Tone requirements: [TONE]
4. Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]
</thinking>

<creation>
[SPECIFIC CREATIVE OUTPUT]
</creation>
```

### 3. Technical Task Template

```xml
<specifications>
- Input format: [FORMAT]
- Output requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]
- Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]
- Success criteria: [CRITERIA]
</specifications>

<examples>
[CODE/TECHNICAL EXAMPLES]
</examples>

<implementation>
[STEP-BY-STEP TECHNICAL RESPONSE]
</implementation>
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Verbose Preamble

```
❌ "I need you to carefully and thoroughly analyze this data, taking into account all possible factors and considerations, and then provide me with a detailed, comprehensive summary that covers all aspects..."

✅ "Analyze this data and provide a detailed summary covering [SPECIFIC ASPECTS]."
```

### 2. The Vague Request

```
❌ "Make this better"

✅ "Improve this code's readability by: adding comments, using descriptive variables, and following PEP-8 style guidelines"
```

### 3. The Example Mismatch

```
❌ Examples show formal writing, but task requires casual tone

✅ Examples match exact style and format needed
```

### 4. The Negative Instruction Focus

```
❌ "Don't be verbose, don't use complex words, don't..."

✅ "Use simple, clear language in 2-3 sentences"
```

[RETRIEVED_RELEVANT_INFORMATION]
</context>

<task>
Based on the context above, [SPECIFIC_TASK]
</task>
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflows

- Break complex tasks across specialized prompts
- Use Claude Code Task tool for parallel research
- Chain outputs between specialized agents

### 4. Dynamic Optimization

- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- A/B test prompt variations continuously
- Use performance metrics to guide improvements
- Adapt prompts based on failure patterns

- **Token Efficiency**: Output quality / Input tokens
- **Consistency Score**: Variance in repeated outputs
- **Speed**: Time to generate response

### Qualitative Assessment

- **Clarity**: Is the response understandable?
- **Completeness**: Does it address all requirements?
- **Usefulness**: Does it solve the actual problem?
- **Safety**: Is it free from harmful content?

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Baseline**: Document current performance
