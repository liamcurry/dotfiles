  name: Brownfield Full-Stack Enhancement
  description: >-
    Agent workflow for enhancing existing full-stack applications with new features,
    modernization, or significant changes. Handles existing system analysis and safe integration.
  type: brownfield
  project_types:
    - feature-addition
    - refactoring
    - modernization
    - integration-enhancement

  # For Complex Enhancements (Multiple Stories, Architectural Changes)
  complex_enhancement_sequence:
    - step: scope_assessment
      agent: any
      action: assess complexity
      notes: "First, assess if this is a simple change (use simple_enhancement_sequence) or complex enhancement requiring full planning."

    - step: project_analysis
      agent: analyst
      action: analyze existing project
      notes: "Review existing documentation, codebase structure, and identify integration points. Document current system understanding before proceeding."

    - agent: pm
      creates: brownfield-prd.md
      uses: brownfield-prd-tmpl
      requires: existing_project_analysis
      notes: "Creates comprehensive brownfield PRD with existing system analysis and enhancement planning. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final brownfield-prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: architect
      creates: brownfield-architecture.md
      uses: brownfield-architecture-tmpl
      requires: brownfield-prd.md
      notes: "Creates brownfield architecture with integration strategy and existing system constraints. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final brownfield-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all brownfield documents for integration safety and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - workflow_end:
      action: move_to_ide
      notes: "All planning artifacts complete. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"

  # For Simple Enhancements (1-3 Stories, Following Existing Patterns)
  simple_enhancement_sequence:
    - step: enhancement_type
      action: choose approach
      notes: "Choose between creating single story (very small change) or epic (1-3 related stories)."

    - agent: pm|po|sm
      creates: brownfield_epic OR brownfield_story
      uses: brownfield-create-epic OR brownfield-create-story
      notes: "Create focused enhancement with existing system integration. Choose agent based on team preference and context."

    - workflow_end:
      action: move_to_ide
      notes: "Enhancement defined. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"

  decision_guidance:
    use_complex_sequence_when:
      - Enhancement requires multiple coordinated stories (4+)
      - Architectural changes are needed
      - Significant integration work required
      - Risk assessment and mitigation planning necessary
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes

    use_simple_sequence_when:
      - Enhancement can be completed in 1-3 stories
      - Follows existing project patterns
      - Integration complexity is minimal
      - Risk to existing system is low
      - Change is isolated with clear boundaries

    architect_to_po: "Architecture complete. Save it as docs/brownfield-architecture.md. Please validate all artifacts for integration safety."
    po_issues: "PO found issues with [document]. Please return to [agent] to fix and re-save the updated document."
    simple_to_ide: "Enhancement defined with existing system integration. Move to IDE environment to begin development."
