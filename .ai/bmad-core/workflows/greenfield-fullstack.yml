  # For Complex Projects (Production-Ready, Multiple Features)
  complex_project_sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - user_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification using front-end-spec-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: v0_prompt (optional)
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

    - agent: architect
      creates: fullstack-architecture.md
      requires:
        - prd.md
        - front-end-spec.md
      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
        - review_generated_ui_structure
      notes: "Creates comprehensive architecture using fullstack-architecture-tmpl. If user generated UI with v0/Lovable, can incorporate the project structure into architecture. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final fullstack-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: fullstack-architecture.md
      condition: architecture_suggests_prd_changes
      notes: "If architect suggests story changes, update PRD and re-export the complete unredacted prd.md to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - project_setup_guidance:
      action: guide_project_structure
      condition: user_has_generated_ui
      notes: "If user generated UI with v0/Lovable: For polyrepo setup, place downloaded project in separate frontend repo alongside backend repo. For monorepo, place in apps/web or packages/frontend directory. Review architecture document for specific guidance."

    - development_order_guidance:
      action: guide_development_sequence
      notes: "Based on PRD stories: If stories are frontend-heavy, start with frontend project/directory first. If backend-heavy or API-first, start with backend. For tightly coupled features, follow story sequence in monorepo setup. Reference sharded PRD epics for development order."

    - workflow_end:
      action: move_to_ide
      notes: "All planning artifacts complete. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"

  # For Simple Projects (Prototypes, MVPs, Quick Experiments)
  simple_project_sequence:
    - step: project_scope
      action: assess complexity
      notes: "First, assess if this needs full planning (use complex_project_sequence) or can be a simple prototype/MVP."

    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
      notes: "Creates focused project brief for simple project. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: simple-project-prd.md
      uses: create doc simple-project-prd OR create-epic OR create-story
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Create simple prd, simple epic or story instead of full PRD for rapid development. Choose based on scope."

    - workflow_end:
      action: move_to_ide
      notes: "Simple project defined. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"
