# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Context

The BMAD Method uses various checklists to ensure quality and completeness of different artifacts. Each checklist contains embedded prompts and instructions to guide the LLM through thorough validation and advanced elicitation. The checklists automatically identify their required artifacts and guide the validation process.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

## Checklist Items

1. **Requirements Met:**

   [[LLM: Be specific - list each requirement and whether it's complete]]

   - [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.

   - [ ] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) with justification.
   - [ ] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies.
   - [ ] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**

   [[LLM: Good documentation prevents future confusion. What needs explaining?]]

   - [ ] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
   - [ ] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users.
   - [ ] Technical documentation (e.g., READMEs, system diagrams) updated if significant architectural changes were made.

## Final Confirmation

[[LLM: FINAL DOD SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize what was accomplished in this story
2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any technical debt or follow-up work needed
4. Note any challenges or learnings for future stories
5. Confirm whether the story is truly ready for review

Be honest - it's better to flag issues now than have them discovered later.]]
