# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

==================== END: tasks#document-project ====================

==================== START: tasks#execute-checklist ====================
# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Context

The BMAD Method uses various checklists to ensure quality and completeness of different artifacts. Each checklist contains embedded prompts and instructions to guide the LLM through thorough validation and advanced elicitation. The checklists automatically identify their required artifacts and guide the validation process.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:

- Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
- Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
- Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
- Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
  - Link to the starter template documentation
  - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
  - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
  - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
  - Project structure and organization patterns
  - Built-in scripts and tooling
  - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
  - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
- Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:

- Suggest appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences
- Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support)
- Let the user decide whether to use one

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:

- Proceed with architecture design from scratch
- Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. In none, just say N/A

After presenting this starter template section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

## High Level Architecture

[[LLM: This section contains multiple subsections that establish the foundation of the architecture. Present all subsections together (Introduction, Technical Summary, High Level Overview, Project Diagram, and Architectural Patterns), then apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol to the complete High Level Architecture section. The user can choose to refine the entire section or specific subsections.]]

### Technical Summary

[[LLM: Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:

- The system's overall architecture style
- Key components and their relationships
- Primary technology choices
- Core architectural patterns being used
- Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them]]

### High Level Overview

[[LLM: Based on the PRD's Technical Assumptions section, describe:

1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)
3. Service architecture decision from PRD
4. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
5. Key architectural decisions and their rationale

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### High Level Project Diagram

[[LLM: Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:

- System boundaries
- Major components/services
- Data flow directions
- External integrations
- User entry points

Use appropriate Mermaid diagram type (graph TD, C4, sequence) based on what best represents the architecture

After presenting the diagram, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Architectural and Design Patterns

[[LLM: List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

1. Present 2-3 viable options if multiple exist
2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

Common patterns to consider:

- Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
- Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
- Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
- Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)]]

<<REPEAT: pattern>>

- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: patterns}

- **Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience

@{/example}

[[LLM: After presenting the patterns, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

## Tech Stack

[[LLM: This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from `data#technical-preferences` or an attached `technical-preferences`
2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons
3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

- Starter templates (if any)
- Languages and runtimes with exact versions
- Frameworks and libraries / packages
- Cloud provider and key services choices
- Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
- Development tools

Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` display - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.]]

==================== END: templates#architecture-tmpl ====================

==================== START: templates#front-end-architecture-tmpl ====================
# {{Project Name}} Frontend Architecture Document

[[LLM: Review provided documents including PRD, UX-UI Specification, and main Architecture Document. Focus on extracting technical implementation details needed for AI frontend tools and developer agents. Ask the user for any of these documents if you are unable to locate and were not provided.]]

## Template and Framework Selection

[[LLM: Before proceeding with frontend architecture design, check if the project is using a frontend starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD, main architecture document, and brainstorming brief for mentions of:

   - Frontend starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vite, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
   - UI kit or component library starters
   - Existing frontend projects being used as a foundation
   - Admin dashboard templates or other specialized starters
   - Design system implementations

2. If a frontend starter template or existing project is mentioned:

   - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
     - Link to the starter template documentation
     - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
     - Share a link to the project repository
   - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
     - Pre-installed dependencies and versions
     - Folder structure and file organization
     - Built-in components and utilities
     - Styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)
     - State management setup (if any)
     - Routing configuration
     - Testing setup and patterns
     - Build and development scripts

- Use this analysis to ensure your frontend architecture aligns with the starter's patterns

3. If no frontend starter is mentioned but this is a new UI, ensure we know what the ui language and framework is:

   - Based on the framework choice, suggest appropriate starters:
     - React: Create React App, Next.js, Vite + React
     - Vue: Vue CLI, Nuxt.js, Vite + Vue
     - Angular: Angular CLI
     - Or suggest popular UI templates if applicable
   - Explain benefits specific to frontend development

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:

# {{Project Name}} Fullstack Architecture Document

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. At minimum, you should have access to docs/prd.md and docs/front-end-spec.md. Ask the user for any documents you need but cannot locate. This template creates a unified architecture that covers both backend and frontend concerns to guide AI-driven fullstack development.]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding with architecture design, check if the project is based on any starter templates or existing codebases:

1. Review the PRD and other documents for mentions of:

- Fullstack starter templates (e.g., T3 Stack, MEAN/MERN starters, Django + React templates)
- Monorepo templates (e.g., Nx, Turborepo starters)
- Platform-specific starters (e.g., Vercel templates, AWS Amplify starters)
- Existing projects being extended or cloned

2. If starter templates or existing projects are mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access (links, repos, or files)
- Analyze to understand pre-configured choices and constraints
- Note any architectural decisions already made
- Identify what can be modified vs what must be retained

3. If no starter is mentioned but this is greenfield:

- Suggest appropriate fullstack starters based on tech preferences
- Consider platform-specific options (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Let user decide whether to use one

4. Document the decision and any constraints it imposes

If none, state "N/A - Greenfield project"

==================== START: checklists#architect-checklist ====================
# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - If this is a UI project (check docs/frontend-architecture.md)
4. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
5. API documentation if available
6. Technology stack details and version specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Does the architecture include a frontend/UI component?
- Is there a frontend-architecture.md document?
- Does the PRD mention user interfaces or frontend requirements?

If this is a backend-only or service-only project:

- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design, service architecture, and integration patterns
- Note in your final report that frontend sections were skipped due to project type

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. REQUIREMENTS ALIGNMENT

[[LLM: Before evaluating this section, take a moment to fully understand the product's purpose and goals from the PRD. What is the core problem being solved? Who are the users? What are the critical success factors? Keep these in mind as you validate alignment. For each item, don't just check if it's mentioned - verify that the architecture provides a concrete technical solution.]]

### 1.1 Functional Requirements Coverage

- [ ] Architecture supports all functional requirements in the PRD
- [ ] Technical approaches for all epics and stories are addressed
- [ ] Edge cases and performance scenarios are considered
- [ ] All required integrations are accounted for
- [ ] User journeys are supported by the technical architecture

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements Alignment

- [ ] Performance requirements are addressed with specific solutions
- [ ] Scalability considerations are documented with approach
- [ ] Security requirements have corresponding technical controls
- [ ] Reliability and resilience approaches are defined
- [ ] Compliance requirements have technical implementations

### 1.3 Technical Constraints Adherence

- [ ] All technical constraints from PRD are satisfied
- [ ] Platform/language requirements are followed
- [ ] Infrastructure constraints are accommodated
- [ ] Third-party service constraints are addressed
- [ ] Organizational technical standards are followed

## 2. ARCHITECTURE FUNDAMENTALS

[[LLM: Architecture clarity is crucial for successful implementation. As you review this section, visualize the system as if you were explaining it to a new developer. Are there any ambiguities that could lead to misinterpretation? Would an AI agent be able to implement this architecture without confusion?

==================== START: utils#template-format ====================
# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **REPEAT** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates
