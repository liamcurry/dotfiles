## Concepts

### Simple Writing Philosophy

Simple writing helps readers understand fast. Complex words and long sentences
slow readers down. Your goal is clear communication, not showing off vocabulary.

### Why Simple Writing Matters

- **Faster reading**: Readers process simple words quicker
- **Better understanding**: Clear sentences reduce confusion
- **Wider audience**: More people understand simple language
- **AI-friendly**: AI agents process simple text more accurately

### Core Approach

Replace complex words with simple ones. Cut unnecessary words. Use active voice.
Split long sentences. Choose familiar words over fancy ones.

## Rules

1. **Use active voice**: "The team fixed the bug" not "The bug was fixed by the
   team"
2. **Cut filler words**: Remove "very," "really," "quite," "rather," "just"
3. **Split complex sentences**: One idea per sentence maximum
4. **Choose simple words**: "use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
5. **Delete redundant phrases**: "completely finished" → "finished"
6. **Use short paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences maximum
7. **Replace phrase with words**: "at this point in time" → "now"
8. **Remove hedge words**: "perhaps," "possibly," "might" (unless uncertain)
9. **Cut wordy phrases**: "in order to" → "to"
10. **Make subjects clear**: Avoid "it is" and "there are" starts
